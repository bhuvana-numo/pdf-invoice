### HTML to PDF Invoice Generation

* Fetch Data from an API
* Use an HTML Template for Formatting
* Replace Placeholders with Data
* Convert HTML to PDF Using a Rendering Engine

#### Rendering Engines used
* Puppeteer
* html-pdf-node
#### Why oudated??
* Security risks (JavaScript execution, malware injection).
* Inconsistent styling (Different browsers render differently).
* Slow performance (Requires a browser engine for rendering).
* Difficult maintenance (Each client has different templates).
* Poor PDF compatibility (Page breaks, fonts, headers don't always work).


## Other Industry methods

### API-Based PDF Generation (Prebuilt Template Services)
Many companies now use third-party services that provide prebuilt templates and APIs for PDF generation.

How It Works:

* Select a pre-designed invoice template (no need to write HTML).
* Send invoice data (customer name, amount, etc.) via an API request.
* The service processes the template and generates a PDF.
### Using Templates (Most Common Method)
* Amazon,Flipkart,Shopify(html templates)
  Ex:E-commerce
* E-commerce Invoices Are Not Highly Regulated
* Faster Development & Easy Customizatio E-commerce businesses need to update invoice designs frequently (brand changes, discount details, new tax rules). HTML templates are easier for developers to modify compared to JasperReports or XML-based templates.
* Most e-commerce customers first see their invoice online before downloading it as a PDF.
* JSON/XML-based templates require more processing logic, whereas HTML templates can directly pull order data and render.
* Flipkart has thousands of sellers using predefined invoice formats. Switching to a new format would require retraining sellers & updating invoice-generation APIs.
#### Why Amazon, Flipkart, and Shopify Still Use HTML-to-PDF
* They have security measures (sanitize input, disable JavaScript).
* They control styling with CSS resets & embedded fonts.
* They optimize performance (pre-generate PDFs, use scalable infrastructure).
* They simplify maintenance with templating engines (Handlebars, Liquid).
* They fix PDF issues with print styles, pagination control, and fixed layouts.

 While HTML-to-PDF has drawbacks, these solutions make it reliable for e-commerce invoices.
 
### API-Based PDF Invoices(Stripe, PayPal: Auto-generates invoices for transactions.


## Alternative Approaches for Html Templates
### 1.)JSON based-JasperReports

* Store invoice data in JSON (e.g., customer details, service fees, tax).
* Use a centralized template (JasperReports .jrxml or iText .xml).
* A rendering engine fills the template dynamically with JSON data.
* A high-quality PDF invoice is generated with proper formatting.
 #### How it overcome html drawbacks  
* JasperReports is designed for PDF rendering, unlike HTML, which is primarily for web pages. It uses native PDF features instead of relying on a browser engine. Here’s how it solves common HTML-to-PDF problems:
* One template works for all clients – JSON provides data, and placeholders insert it dynamically.* No need to maintain multiple HTML files – If a new client adds a field (e.g., shipping_fee), you just update the template once.
* Handles missing fields – If a JSON field is absent, it simply doesn’t show up in the PDF.
* No need for a web browser, JavaScript, or DOM execution. Direct data processing prevents security vulnerabilities.
* No browser engine (like Chrome or wkhtmltopdf) is needed. Direct JSON-to-PDF conversion is faster and lightweight.

### 2.)Docx-Based Template Conversion (Using Word Templates)
Used By: Enterprise companies, banks, legal & financial industries.

How It Works
* A .docx (Microsoft Word) file is created as a template with placeholders (e.g., {customer_name}).
* JSON data is injected into placeholders dynamically.
* The modified .docx is converted into a PDF using a rendering engine.


### 3.)LaTeX-Based PDF Invoice Generation 
* Create the LaTeX Template 
* We use Jinja2 for injecting JSON data into the LaTeX template and compile it using pdflatex.
* Convert to pdf

#### Overcoming Html drawbacks
* LaTeX doesn’t execute JavaScript. It’s purely a text-based document processing tool, eliminating malware risks.
* LaTeX ensures consistent formatting across all platforms, independent of browsers.
* LaTeX compiles directly into a PDF, removing the need for a web browser.
